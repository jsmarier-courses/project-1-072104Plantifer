   <p>Discovering new study cafes in Ottawa or new food places has significantly improved my productivity. As much as I enjoy the feeling of familiarity my house provides me, I dislike the feeling of following a repetitve routine. I prefer keeping a balance between following a routine while exploring other options that aren't time consuming. This leads to me explaining how discovering new study cafes and food places improved my studies and lifestyle. Many say that chewing gum helps with their studies, because the chewing motion keeps them concentrated. For me, ordering drinks and snacks, studying in another environment, and documenting the moment with pictures motivates me to get productive. Since I paid to be there, I might as well make the most out of it. I've come to find out that the friendly, cozy and relaxing cafe atmosphere has increased my creativity and ability to learn. No matter how you look at it, it's a win because all the time being consumed resulted in me putting more effort into my work, which gave me higher grades. Additionally, I also have a fun time in return. On days I change things up and choose to study in Morisset Library or the STEM building, sometimes, my main motivator is treating myself to a nice meal with my friends. Being able to spend quality time with my friends while eating out naturally relieves my stress and boosts my happiness. The ability to bring constant feelings of happiness into my studies was able to set a positive mindset towards school. </p>
